# Responsible Use and Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)

SATL is a research prototype intended for privacy-preserving networking research and legitimate privacy use-cases. The project is not intended to facilitate illegal activity.

By using SATL you agree to the following guidelines:

- Do not use SATL to conduct illegal activities, abuse, harassment, or to facilitate attacks (DDoS, fraud, intrusion).
- Do not use SATL to distribute malware or to avoid lawful interception when a court order exists.
- Use SATL in ways that respect others' privacy, infrastructure and terms of service.
- If you operate a public service built on SATL, provide clear contact and abuse reporting channels and respond promptly to abuse reports.

Enforcement
- This is a community project; enforcement is primarily social and infrastructural (removal of public mirrors, takedown of public services violating the AUP where we have authority).

Reporting abuse
- Report abuse to: security@satl.example.com

Note: This AUP is not a substitute for local laws and regulations. Always follow applicable law.
