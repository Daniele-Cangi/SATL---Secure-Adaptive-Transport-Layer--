# Security Policy

Thank you for your interest in reporting security issues in SATL.

This document describes how to report vulnerabilities and how we handle reports.

Reporting
- Email: security@satl.example.com (PGP key available in repo: `SECURITY_KEY.pub`)
- Use the subject: "[SECURITY] SATL vulnerability report"
- Provide: steps to reproduce, affected version, network topology if relevant, proof-of-concept (PoC) if available, and an encrypted archive if data is sensitive.

Response policy
- We will acknowledge receipt within 3 business days.
- We will respond with an initial triage and expected timeline within 7 business days.
- Critical issues will be treated with priority and a patch will be prepared as soon as reasonably possible.

Coordinated disclosure
- We ask reporters to coordinate disclosure with the SATL team while we prepare fixes.
- If immediate public disclosure is necessary (e.g., exploit in the wild), please explain the circumstances in your report.

Credits
- We welcome contributors and will credit researchers who follow this policy. If you wish to remain anonymous, indicate that in your report.

Contact
- security@satl.example.com

Note: Replace `security@satl.example.com` with your project/security contact before publishing publicly.
